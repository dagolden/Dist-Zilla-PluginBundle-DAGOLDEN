## HOW TO CONTRIBUTE

Thank you for considering contributing to this distribution.  This file
contains instructions that will help you work with the source code.

The distribution is managed with Dist::Zilla.  This means than many of the
usual files you might expect are not in the repository, but are generated
at release time (e.g. Makefile.PL).

### Getting dependencies

See the included `cpanfile` file for a list of dependencies.  If you have
App::cpanminus 1.6 or later installed, you can use `cpanm` to satisfy
dependencies like this:

    $ cpanm --installdeps .

Otherwise, you can install Module::CPANfile 1.0002 or later and then satisfy
dependencies with the regular `cpan` client and `cpanfile-dump`:

    $ cpan `cpanfile-dump`

### Running tests

You can run tests directly using the `prove` tool:

    $ prove -l
    $ prove -lv t/some_test_file.t

For most distributions, `prove` is entirely sufficent for you to test any
patches you have.

### Patching documentation

Likewise, much of the documentation Pod is generated at release time.
Depending on the distribution, some documentation may be written in a Pod
dialect called WikiDoc. (See Pod::WikiDoc on CPAN.)

If you would like to submit a documentation edit, please limit yourself to the
documentation you see.

If you see typos or documentation issues in the generated docs, please
email or open a bug ticket instead of patching.

### Learning Dist::Zilla

Dist::Zilla is a very powerful authoring tool, but requires a number of
author-specific plugins.  If you would like to use it for contributing,
install it from CPAN, then run one of the following commands, depending on
your CPAN client:

    $ cpan `dzil authordeps`
    $ dzil authordeps | cpanm

Once installed, here are some dzil commands you might try:

    $ dzil build
    $ dzil test
    $ dzil xtest
